## My process

- Wrote HTML.
- Wrote CSS section by section, originally using tailwindcss, which was later refactored to vanilla CSS (to get rid of the HTML validation errors when Frontend Mentor parsed the solution).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ~~[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - framework~~
